**Flashcard Quiz App **

**Overview**
This project involves building a flashcard-style quiz application using Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management. Users will be able to create topics, quizzes, and flashcards, as well as interact with the quizzes by flipping the flashcards over. The project is structured in a way that helps you implement the app's Redux logic incrementally, starting with topics, followed by quizzes, and finally, flashcards.

**Features**
•	Create Topics: Users can create different topics for organizing their quizzes.
•	Create Quizzes: Users can create quizzes under each topic.
•	Create Flashcards: Users can create flashcards for each quiz.
•	Flip Flashcards: Users can interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards to see the answers.

**Project Structure**
The project is divided into several tasks that guide you through implementing the Redux logic:
**1.	Topics:** Implementing state management for topics.
**2.	Quizzes:** Implementing state management for quizzes.
**3.	Flashcards:** Implementing state management for flashcards.

**Installation**
**1.	Clone the Repository:**
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flashcard-quiz-app.git
cd flashcard-quiz-app
**2.	Install Dependencies:**
bash
Copy code
npm install
**3.	Start the Application:**
bash
Copy code
npm start

**Technologies Used**
**•	React:** For building the user interface.
**•	Redux: **For managing the application state.
**•	Redux Toolkit:** For simplifying Redux logic and setup.
